- Some of the code (particularly the code for the various continuous
  distributions, but many other smaller bits and pieces in addition to that) is
  taken almost verbatim from Python's standard library random module; thanks go
  to Raymond Hettinger, Tim Peters, Guido van Rossum, and the many other
  contributors to that module.
- Thanks to Rich Wareham for extra reproducibility testing.
